# analogue-socd-resolution

Rappy Snappy & Snap Tap for analogue keyboards in software.

> [!WARNING]
> I can not guarantee the safety of this in games with anti-cheat. In the case of CS2, this is not allowed, and they have a detection that can even detect in-firmware SOCD resolution.

## Supported Keyboards

This project supports [all analogue keyboards that Soup supports](https://github.com/calamity-inc/universal-analog-plugin/issues/1), but is mainly aimed at Keychron Q1 HE and Drunkdeer keyboards. Notably, however, keyboards from Wooting and the Razer Huntsman series are also supported.

## Instructions

1. Download `analogue-socd-resolution.zip` from [the latest release](https://github.com/Sainan/analogue-socd-resolution/releases).
2. Extract the zip.
3. Open a command prompt in the folder where `sethook.exe` now resides.
4. Execute `sethook.exe` or `sethook.exe priority` for "furthest down" (Rappy Snappy) or "last input priority" (Snap Tap), respectively.
